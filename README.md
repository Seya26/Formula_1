Project for the Programming Methodologies exam at the University of Camerino. The project consists of designing a game that simulates a Formula 1 race. Two text files are included to manage the participating drivers and the race track. The game features both human players, who can choose their moves, and bot players, who move randomly around the track. An interactive terminal menu is provided to manage the gameplay.
